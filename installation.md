## 1. Pre-requisites
Before proceeding you will need: 

    1. git
    2. g++ (>=7 for VcPkg)
    3. make or ninja
    4. cmake
    5. unzip
    6. curl 
    7. tar
    
Those are basic pre-requisites for both ns-3 and VcPkg, used in this version of ns-3 for dependencies installation. The [official ns-3 branch](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/) uses Bake for dependencies installation.

## 2. Fetching the code
After installing the dependencies, clone the [ns-3 with CMake](https://github.com/Gabrielcarvfer/NS3) repository. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Gabrielcarvfer/NS3.git
```

You can use shallow clone to speed things up.
```
git clone --branch master --single-branch https://github.com/Gabrielcarvfer/NS3.git
```

## 3. CMake configuration 
You can choose either command line tools or IDEs that support CMake projects (e.g. [Jetbrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) ).


### 3.1 CMake configuration with command line 
Navigate to the cloned NS3 folder, create a CMake cache folder, navigate to it and run [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html) pointing to the NS3 folder.
```
cd NS3
mkdir cmake-cache
cd cmake-cache
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=**look the tables below** -G"**look the tables below**" ..
```
You can pass arguments to the CMake command, to configure it.

To set the build type (debug or release) you will need to set the value of a variable (-D) named [CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html) with the preset you want. You can choose one of the following:

| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE | [Effects  (g++)](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Modules/Compiler/GNU.cmake)  |
|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| DEBUG            | -g              |
| RELEASE          | -O3 -DNDEBUG    |
| RELWITHDEBINFO   | -O2 -g -DNDEBUG |
| MINSIZEREL       | -Os -DNDEBUG    |

You can also choose the generator for your preferred [buildsystem](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) with the following argument: -G "generator name (with double quotes)"

| Generators       | 
|:----------------:|
| MinGW Makefiles  | 
| Unix  Makefiles  | 
| MSYS  Makefiles  | 
| Ninja            | 
| Xcode            |
| Visual Studio *VERSION* *YEAR* |

The Visual Studio generator also takes two flags to complete the build triplet.

| Function | CMake flag | Options |
|:--------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| Specify architecture | -A | x86,x64,x86_x64,x64_x86 |
| Specify tool chain | -T | ClangCL |

For specific ns-3 options, I recommend making a copy of the .cmake.template file and rename to .cmake, and then set the flags you want.
You could also edit NS3/CMakeLists.txt directly, but that's usually a bad idea.

You can also use an IDE that supports CMake projects. 
Jetbrains CLion is the best one, but Visual Studio also exists for those who like it.
With both of them, you load the folder as a project, and they will look for the CMakeLists.txt file.

If the flag to automatically install dependencies is enabled, [VcPkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) will be used.
It is compiled and then downloads and build required dependencies during the first `cmake` run. 
This can take quite some time.

The `cmake` command will be used in the future, as it triggers the automatic copy of headers from NS3/src to /NS3/build/NS3.
It is also used discover newer targets (libraries, executables and/or modules that were created since the last run). 
This is known as reloading/updating the CMake cache.

### 3.2 CMake configuration with CLion
CLion uses Makefiles for your platform as the default generator. 

The following image contains the toolchain configuration for CLion running on Windows.

The following image contains the CMake configuration for CLion running on Windows. 
Here you can choose a better generator like `ninja` by setting the cmake options flag to `-G Ninja`.

![configuration](/NS3/img/cmake_configuration.png)

To reload the CMake cache, triggering the copy of new headers and discovery of new targets (libraries, executables and/or modules), you can either configure to re-run CMake automatically after editing CMake files (pretty slow and easily triggered) or reload manually. The following image shows how to trigger the CMake cache reload.
![reload_cache](/NS3/img/reload_cache.png)

### 3.3 CMake configuration with Visual Studio
Visual Studio is cursed and uses nmake/msbuild as generators.
Start by opening the folder as a project.
![vs_open_project](/NS3/img/vs/vs_open_folder_as_project.png)

Then right-click the CMakeLists.txt file and click to generate the cmake cache.
![vs_generate_cache](/NS3/img/vs/vs_generate_cmake_cache.png)

REMINDER: Only ClangCl is supported. You must open the cmake configuration panel that Visual Studio provides,
look for advanced settings and select the appropriate clangcl toolchain. It won't build with the MSVC (cl.exe) compiler.
![vs_change_cmake_settings](/NS3/img/vs/vs_change_cmake_settings.png)
![vs_set_clang_toolchain](/NS3/img/vs/vs_set_clang_toolchain.png)

Visual Studio should regenerate the caches after that.

## 4 Building the project
After the configuration, you will have multiple targets (for libraries and executables). Again, you can choose either command line tools or IDEs that support CMake projects to build and link those targets.


### 4.1 Building the project with command line
If you selected the Makefiles generator, you can run the `make` command to build specific targets and `make all` to build all targets.
You can also run `make clean` to remove built libraries and executables before rebuilding them.

### 4.2 Building the project with CLion
You can select the desired target on a drop-down list and then click the hammer symbol, as shown in the image below.
![build_targets](/NS3/img/build_targets.png)

### 4.3 Building the project with Visual Studio
To select your target, you should switch from project files to projects view
in the solution explorer.
![vs_switch_to_targets](/NS3/img/vs/vs_switch_to_targets.png)

![vs_targets](/NS3/img/vs/vs_targets.png)

You can then click on either the play button or use the main Menu->Build->Build All.
![vs_build_debug_target](/NS3/img/vs/vs_build_debug_target.png)

![vs_build_project](/NS3/img/vs/vs_build_project.png)

## 5. Running built executables
After building executables, they will be placed in NS3/build/bin. To run them, you can either use the command line or your prefered IDE.

### 5.1 Running executables with command line
Navigate to NS3/build/bin and run the executable.
```
cd ../build/bin
./executable_name
```
If you want to rebuild it, you will need to navigate back to the cmake-cache folder.
```
cd ../../cmake-cache
```

### 5.2 Running executables with CLion
Select the desired target to run from the drop-down list and then click either: the play button to execute the program;
the bug to debug the program; the play button with a chip, to run Valgrind and analyze memory usage, leaks and so on.

## 6. Creating a new module
As [Waf](https://waf.io/) (the official buildsystem) was replaced with CMake, the required steps to create a new module for the ns-3 change slightly.

Instead of a wscript per module, you will need a CMakeLists.txt file. As an example, let's take the Applications module wscript and compare to the CMakeLists.txt that replaced it.

### Applications Wscript
```
def build(bld):
    module = bld.create_ns3_module('applications', ['internet', 'config-store','stats'])
    module.source = [
        'model/bulk-send-application.cc',
        ...
        ]

    applications_test = bld.create_ns3_module_test_library('applications')
    applications_test.source = [
        'test/three-gpp-http-client-server-test.cc', 
        ...
        ]

    headers = bld(features='ns3header')
    headers.module = 'applications'
    headers.source = [
        'model/bulk-send-application.h',
        ...
        ]
```

### Applications CMakeLists.txt
```


set(name applications)

set(source_files
        model/bulk-send-application.cc
        ...
        )

set(header_files
        model/bulk-send-application.h
        ...
        )

#link to dependencies
set(libraries_to_link
        ${libinternet}
        ${libconfig-store}
        ${libstats}
        )

set(test_sources
        test/udp-client-server-test.cc
        ...
    )

build_lib("${name}" "${source_files}" "${header_files}" "${libraries_to_link}" "${test_sources}")
```

After you finish working on your CMakeLists.txt, add your new module to the libs_to_build list in the NS3/CMakeLists.txt file.

Reconfigure your CMake project (step 3) to automatically copy the headers to NS3/build/NS3 and create the appropriate buildsystem files to build your module related targets.
